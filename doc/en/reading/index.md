# 📚 AI Implementation Reading Notes

Entering the workplace, when we undertake some projects, we often feel confused about the future and the road is tortuous. Sometimes I also want to find an excuse to rot, such as: "The environment is too bad", "Nothing is available", "Work more than a cow for little money".

But on second thought: **Instead of complaining, it is better to improve yourself.**
