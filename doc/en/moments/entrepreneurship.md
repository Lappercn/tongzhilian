## What is Long-termism?

In the fast-paced Internet era, everyone is talking about "trends", "dividends", and "quick success". But at NexCore, we prefer to talk about "Long-termism".

To me, long-termism is not an empty slogan, but a **choice**.

*   Choosing **difficult but correct things**, rather than simple and profitable things.
*   Choosing to **polish product details**, rather than rushing to launch to harvest traffic.
*   Choosing to **treat every customer sincerely**, rather than a one-time deal.

## Why Persist?

### 1. Trust is the Source of Compound Interest
Technical service is essentially a transaction of trust. Clients entrusting their core business to us is a great trust. Only through high-quality delivery time and again can we build a solid barrier of trust. This trust will generate compound interest effects over time, bringing more word-of-mouth recommendations.

### 2. Technology Needs Accumulation
Algorithm models change, frameworks change, but the underlying logic of engineering does not. We do not pursue every hotspot, but focus on building a robust underlying architecture and efficient R&D flow. This accumulation allows us to handle new technologies more calmly.

## Our Practice

At NexCore, we advocate:

*   **Code Cleanliness**: Even backend code that customers can't see should be written as elegantly as a poem.
*   **Documentation Driven**: No code without documentation, ensuring the inheritability of knowledge.
*   **Review Culture**: Whether the project succeeds or fails, we must review and learn from experience.

## Final Words

Entrepreneurship is a marathon, not a 100-meter sprint. We may not walk fast enough, but every step we take is steady. Thanks to every partner who walks with us, let's go to see the scenery further away together.
